# AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance Platform

## Overview
An end-to-end cloud-native solution for real-time equipment failure prediction, combining AI/ML, DevOps automation, and big data processing. Built with industry-standard scalability and reliability patterns.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Frontend Application**
   - React-based SPA containerized with Docker
   - Material-UI for responsive dashboard components
   - Real-time data visualization using D3.js/Chart.js
   - WebSocket integration for live equipment metrics
   - Hosted in Nginx container

2. **Backend Services**
   - Node.js/Python microservices architecture
   - RESTful API endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
   - gRPC for inter-service communication
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Containerized with Docker

3. **ML Pipeline (Optional Enhancement)**
   - Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming and ETL
   - Alternative cloud services:
     - AWS: Kinesis, SageMaker, EMR
     - Azure: Event Hubs, Azure ML, Databricks
   - Data preprocessing and feature engineering pipelines
   - Model training and validation workflows
   - Model serving infrastructure with:
     - Self-hosted: TensorFlow Serving, Seldon Core
     - Cloud-managed: SageMaker endpoints, Azure ML endpoints
   - A/B testing capabilities

4. **Data Layer**
   - PostgreSQL for transactional data
   - MongoDB for equipment metrics and sensor data
   - Redis for caching and real-time data
   - MinIO/S3 for model artifacts storage

5. **DevOps & Infrastructure**
   - Docker and Docker Compose for containerization
   - GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines
   - Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
   - Basic monitoring and logging setup

```

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Container Strategy
- Each service should have its own Dockerfile
- Multi-stage builds for optimized images
- Use of Docker Compose for local development and orchestration
- Container security scanning in CI/CD

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline Requirements
```yaml
stages:
  - lint
  - build
  - security-scan
  - deploy-staging
  - deploy-production
```

## Development Requirements
